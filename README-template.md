## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learnt how to use background image properties,HTML semantics(basics).
I also learnt how to use embeded svg files and manipulate the background colours


### Continued development
I would like to improve on my HTML layout as i always find it difficult to group 
elements together and be able to efficiently manipulate them in CSS


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33IinMVJf-M) - This helped me understand the different background image properties and be able to apply them in my current project
